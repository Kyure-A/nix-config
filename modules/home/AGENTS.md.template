# Agent Guidelines

<!-- Do not restructure or delete sections. Update individual values in-place when they change. -->

## Core Principles

- **Do NOT maintain backward compatibility** unless explicitly requested. Break things boldly.
- **Keep this file under 20-30 lines of instructions.** Every line competes for the agent's limited context budget (~150-200 total).

### Regarding command execution
If you're trying to run a command and it doesn't exist, first check if the directory contains either of these files:
- `devenv.nix`
- `flake.nix`

If neither exists, please use `nix-shell` to run the command. Do not install the command globally.

## Project Overview

<!-- Update this section as the project takes shape -->

**Primary language:** [To be determined]

---

```

---

## Maintenance Notes

<!-- This section is permanent. Do not delete. -->

**Keep this file lean and current:**

1. **Remove placeholder sections** (sections still containing `[To be determined]` or `[Add your ... here]`) once you fill them in
2. **Review regularly** - stale instructions poison the agent's context
3. **CRITICAL: Keep total under 20-30 lines** - move detailed docs to separate files and reference them
4. **Update commands immediately** when workflows change
5. **Delete anything the agent can infer** from your code
